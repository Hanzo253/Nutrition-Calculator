# Nutrition-Calculator

A web app that lets users search up food to check how much nutrients it will give after it is consumed.

Project Specifications:

- Used Nutritionix API to get the data of nutrients
- After entering search input, results will contain food name and food brand
- Clicking on a food item will display its nutrients per serving and will prompt the user to input how many servings they have eaten
- Total amount of nutrients gained will be shown after the app has calculated with the number of servings the user has inputted

## How I worked on this project

- I worked with tasks on a ClickUp board: [Screenshot of tasks](https://lensdump.com/a/giQox)
- I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE
- Developed this app with mainly HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript
- Used jQuery for AJAX to fetch data from the Nutritionix API: [Nutritionix API website](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
- Used a little bit of bootstrap icons: [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Why I built the project this way

- I wanted to improve on fetching data from API, so I felt like this project helped me learn how to use APIs better.
- I did mostly HTML, CSS/SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript because I am focusing on becoming a developer with them
- I used the Nutritionix API because it had nurtrition facts for brand foods
- I developed this app to let users and myself be able to search for the nutrition facts of various food

## If I had more time I would change this

- Unfortunately this API has problems fetching data in mobile devices, so I would find another that works with small devices
- I would like to create a better design for the app and make it look smoother
- Add integration testing, unit testing, and end-to-end testing
- Add pictures of the selected food item to the modals, but the API I am currently using does not come with any images that work.
