# Nutrition-Calculator [Finished but I will update it to polish the app a bit more]

A web app that lets users search up food to check how much nutrients it will give after it is consumed.

Project Specifications:

- Used Nutritionix API to get the data of nutrients
- After entering search input, results will contain food name and food brand
- Clicking on a food item will display its nutrients per serving and will prompt the user to input how many servings they have eaten
- Total amount of nutrients gained will be shown after the app has calculated with the number of servings the user has inputted
